## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I honestly didn't liked so much the end result on this one, I hard a hard time trying to get the sizes as accurate and precise as possible according to the example picture. I may re-do it later to get it better.
